    "4. What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, provide a concise way to create small, one-line functions in Python. While they have some advantages over regular functions, they also come with certain limitations. Let's explore the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a). Concise Syntax: Lambda functions allow you to define simple functions in a compact manner. They are typically written in a single line, making them useful for short, one-time-use functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b). Anonymous Nature: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't require a name. This can be useful when you need a function for a specific purpose without the need for reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c). Function as Arguments: Lambda functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. This is especially handy when using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(). It enables you to define small functions inline without the need for a separate function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d). Readability in Context: When used in conjunction with other higher-order functions, lambda functions can improve code readability by keeping the logic concise and inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a). Single Expression: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression. They cannot contain multiple statements or complex logic. If your function requires multiple statements or more complex operations, a regular function is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Statements or Documentation: Lambda functions can only contain expressions, not statements like if, for, or return. They are primarily intended for simple calculations or transformations. Additionally, they cannot include docstrings for documentation, making them less suitable for complex or self-explanatory code.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b). Lack of Reusability: Due to their anonymous nature, lambda functions cannot be reused in multiple places within your code. They are generally used for immediate and short-lived operations rather than as standalone functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c). Limited Functionality: Lambda functions are not as flexible as regular functions. They are unable to handle more complex scenarios that regular functions can, such as recursion, exception handling, or accessing variables outside their scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, lambda functions provide a convenient way to create simple functions on the fly, especially when used in combination with higher-order functions. However, for more complex operations, regular functions offer greater flexibility, reusability, and readability"
